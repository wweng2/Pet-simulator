# Pet-simulator
A test of a pet simulator

This was a test to create a pet simulator game in python when i was younger and did have multiple class that represented pets and a interface for the simulator the allow for the selction of pets and the player but nothing else and it went super bad to to scope creep and no clear vision and such is jsut a reminder how having a plan and not to keep expanding when you cant afford too.
